# Building a MongoDB database with football stats. 
In this project a **MongoDB** database with stats and physical data of the football players of Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, Bundesliga
and Ligue 1 of the seasons from 2017-2018 to 2020-2021 is built. Three data resources were used: **Understat, api-football and Fbref**. The data was
collected combining **scraping and APIs**. In this repository you can find the notebook with the code (English) and the paper and presentation of the 
project (Italian). You can download the database at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/diegobartoli/top5legauesplayers-statsandphys.

This project was done for the exam **Data Management** for the MSc in Data Science at the University Milano-Biccocca of Milan.
